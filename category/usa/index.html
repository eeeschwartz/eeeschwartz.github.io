  <p>Seriously with that guy? Amazing. So, we are back in the good ol&#8217; Midwest for a short stint. We came back to Chicago about 2 weeks ago, but have really spent most of our time here in Wisconsin. Since we&#8217;re not quite ready to admit we&#8217;ve actually left Hawaii, it&#8217;s been nice to get out of the city a bit....</p>

  <p>For as much as we&#8217;re on the road, we really don&#8217;t stay in hotels all too often. We usually try to make our trip as much like &#8216;home&#8217; as we possibly can. But since we took a little time off while we were in Hawaii, we did a few shorter stints at hotels around the islands. Hotels aren&#8217;t always worth...</p>

  <p>It was a cloudy, rainy day when we headed out to the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial. Despite the typically sunny Hawaiian climate, this day&#8217;s weather seemed to lend itself to the somber nature of this visit. The memorial is beautifully and respectfully designed above the wreckage of the ship by Honolulu resident and architect Alfred Preis. Previous to designing the structure,...</p>

  <p>Honolulu is a crazy city on a tiny island with that same weird pluralist feeling that many port cities have. It&#8217;s a little bit Marseilles, a little bit Tokyo and a little bit LA. It&#8217;s big, bustling but not quite settled into a singular identity. The one thing that is repetitious about this town are the crayon-colored &#8220;Corbusiers&#8221; all over...</p>

  <p>OMG- we can&#8217;t stop hiking! I have to say, this is a pretty fantastic addition to our travel repitoire. We&#8217;ve never really done lots of hiking before, mostly because I refused to buy the proper footwear. This time, we made sure to stock up on ultra-dorky hiking sandals before heading out to Hawaii. And seriously, it was the best decision....</p>

  <p>After spending some time on the south and west sides of Kauai, we headed up north to Hanalei Bay. This is an idyllic setting, a peaceful beachfront surrounded by lush flora and cliffs and shorelines for days. It&#8217;s a quaint little town that&#8217;s only somewhat overrun by tourists and only accessible by a one-lane bridge. Even though the main business...</p>

It&#8217;s really hard to illustrate the scale of how vast this canyon is by photos alone. You really have to go.

We quickly got used to early nights and early mornings, chickens, guineas and sweet puppies coming to visit us in our little cabin. Luckily for us, we got to reap the benefits of country living without performing any actual chores on the farm....</p>

  <p>Cheers to the USA! It&#8217;s been a really incredible three months abroad, but we&#8217;re finally back and looking forward to a fun summer at home. We touched down for a few days in Austin, TX for SXSW. South by Southwest is a conference of insane tech, film and music industry types who take over this laid-back city in droves. It...</p>

  <p>We were slightly concerned. During our last weekend in Michigan, we decided to take a little trip with Jess and John and our friends Holly and Dave to Gigi&#8217;s Cabaret in Detroit. When we pulled up to the parking lot, I have to admit I was a bit confused by the less than fabulous exterior. It looked more 8 Mile...</p>

  <p>We got out and about quite a bit this weekend. Friday night, we headed to Sidetrack in downtown Ypsilanti. I love coming to Sidetrack around Christmastime, as it&#8217;s one of the most cozy places in town. Strong, stout beer served up with a side of traditional bar fare makes it fun for the whole fam. And of course, no trip...</p>

  <p>So we&#8217;ve been in Michigan for about a week now, and things are getting serious. Seriously cold, that is. I guess this whole adventure wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a tiny dose of winter. We can take our lumps&#8230; we&#8217;ve got warm weather in store sooner than is fair. We&#8217;ve mostly stayed home with the family; Erik&#8217;s sister Jessica, her husband...</p>

  <p>After we took the official tour of Four Roses Distillery, we took our Bourbon Trail passports and headed down the Bluegrass Parkway to Woodford Reserve Distillery in Woodford County. A much more beautiful campus than Four Roses, you can immediately see why Woodford is the bourbon used in the $1000 mint julep at the Kentucky Derby. Woodford Reserve sits on...</p>

  <p>So, I haven&#8217;t even thought about making let alone selling a painting in over 5 years, but it&#8217;s amazing what you have time for when you&#8217;re unemployed! My sister-in-law mentioned an art auction fundraiser for a local non-profit so I thought, hey, why not? It was all for a good cause, and it&#8217;s always nice to add a little cash...</p>

  <p>Last weekend, feeling adventurous, we decided to bravely trek the Bourbon Trail. We began our journey at Four Roses Distellery about 45 minutes from Lexington, near the banks of The Salt River. The legend of Four Roses as told by our tour guide, is one of true love. The founder of the distillery fell in head over heels in love...</p>

Roscoe is a chocolate lab with a powerful wag and some of the most amazing drool you&#8217;ve ever seen. Regardless, we love him and it&#8217;s been really fun having our little buddy around these...</p>

  <p>You guys&#8211; we bought a car! There&#8217;s nothing like plopping down a huge chunk of cash to make you feel like an adult. After living car-free for several years in Chicago, we knew we&#8217;d have to bite the bullet and buy a car for the domestic legs of our travels. One of our best buddies has driven a Toyota Matrix...</p>

  <p>Fall in the South is such a relief to the past 10 autumns we spent in Chicago. With temperatures reaching into the 70&#8217;s most days, we&#8217;ve been taking advantage with lots of outdoor activities. On our first free Sunday here, we hiked at Raven Run, a nature sanctuary just inside the city limits. I came here quite a bit in...</p>

  <p>We begin our journey in my hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. Here in the Heart of the Bluegrass, many old tobacco farms have had difficulty making ends meet (Sad.) because Americans are smoking less. (Yay!) But what to do with all of these tobacco farms? Many of these farms have found new lives as wineries. Kentucky&#8217;s fertile soil and temperate climate...</p>
