            By: Smith Schwartz |
            <time datetime="2012-12-18 06:14:42 -0500">18 Dec 2012</time>
          </p>
        <p>A few weeks back, I had an email exchange with a friend-of-a-friend who&#8217;s considering taking a break from the daily grind and moving to Ecuador for a short period of time. We&#8217;ve been having a nice back and forth about work, travel and logistics and I realize that even though we&#8217;ve been working and traveling for over a year, I haven&#8217;t really talked much about the work side of things publicly, and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to do more of. She was kind enough to agree to let me publish a portion of our exchange.</p>

<p>Her letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure how we settled on Ecuador as our destination spot, but somehow we did&#8230;and now we are really stoked to go. We are hoping to head there in mid-January. I am nervous about a few things&#8211;mostly, leaving my job and all my stuff. (But also, really happy for the adventure and challenge.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you worked while on the road? My boyfriend is a freelancer, so he plans on working along the way. How did you work out stuff like insurance?</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m not sure how much pre-planning we should do before getting there&#8211;like, do you have a place to stay set up and everything? I tend to over-plan while my boyfriend is more apt to wing it. We only plan to be there for 6-8 weeks, but I&#8217;d like to spend time enjoying it, not being stressed about where we are staying, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway any advice you have on the basics would be great to hear! Thanks a million in advance!!</p>

<p>My response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so excited for your plans. Taking a risk is always better than sitting home wondering &#8220;what if?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#8217;re actually back in Chicago now, but leaving soon to visit family for the holidays and then off to Hawaii for Jan-Feb. I&#8217;m pretty excited for something a little &#8220;easier&#8221;.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll find that a little break from the working world will help you as you move forward or even make a change in your career. It certainly did for me. I learned things about myself and gained perspective in a way that just isn&#8217;t possible when I was working everyday. That said, I&#8217;m now back to working full-time, but I&#8217;ve made a pretty drastic career change.</p>

<p>I came from the museum world. I had some really fun jobs, but they were low paying and I felt stuck. There aren&#8217;t a huge number of opportunities for advancement and you can only live in certain cities. I loved my coworkers and the work I was doing, so leaving was hard, but I was hopeful I could figure out something that was a better fit for the way I wanted to live. After a year of hard work and the ups and downs of starting over (which I&#8217;m still going through), I&#8217;m now working as a front-end web developer/designer and I really love it.</p>

<p>My husband is a software engineer, so he was able to work out a situation where he kept his full-time employment, (insurance, etc.) as we traveled. This has been huge for us and things really would have been a lot different if this situation hadn&#8217;t worked out. We were determined to do it either way, so we saved my salary for about a year and a half prior to leaving to practice living on one salary and to have a cushion just in case!</p>

<p>I definitely land on the side of planning ahead. Living in a new country is fantastic, but it can be hard, too. I always secure a place to stay ahead of time, not only for peace of mind but it&#8217;s harder to fine long-term lodging on the spot. I&#8217;ve actually just booked out all of our lodging until the end of March next year, so yeah, I&#8217;m kind of nutty about it, but it makes living without a home a little easier knowing that you have some spots lined up.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ll need a reliable wifi connection for your boyfriend&#8217;s work? We&#8217;ve had pretty good luck on Airbnb with lodging- I would ask all kinds of questions before booking about wifi and figure out where you can go in case of an outage (coffee shops, libraries, etc). There&#8217;s nothing worse than having no wifi and trying to look for wifi! Also, check around to see if there are any co-working spaces near where you&#8217;ll be. We&#8217;ve found those as a good break to working from home and it&#8217;s an easy way to meet locals.</p>

<p>I also wrote a lot about this on Apartment Therapy. Here&#8217;s a <a href='http://pinterest.com/smithschwartz/well-designed-travel/'>Pinboard</a> I made of the articles I wrote that are specifically about travel. (Yes, I&#8217;m a nerd.) Some of them might be helpful to you as you prepare. Also, I&#8217;d highly recommend starting a blog. It&#8217;s great for everyone to hear what you&#8217;re up to, it handy when trying to meet people on the road and it will help you record and process everything as it&#8217;s happening.</p>

<p>Keep in touch and keep me updated!</p>

<p>If anyone else out there is considering a nomadic lifestyle, please be in touch! I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>
