You guys, went rock climbing this weekend!

Psych, we went on a hike at the Barton Creek Greenbelt and took photos of some dude we don't know! We watched him try to flip up and over, but that huge cactus had other ideas.

It's pretty amazing that this place is just a few minutes drive from downtown Austin.
