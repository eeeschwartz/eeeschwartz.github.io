No, really. With the exception of a few days early in December, it's been hot, sunny and slightly breezy for the duration of our trip. Pretty much perfect, if you ask me.

Our favorite brunch spot, Oui, Oui

Part of this new lifestyle of ours is all about always having an open door. Be it trying new things, meeting new people or learning a new language, we want to remain open as we travel from place to place. Another aspect of that openness is to invite everyone else along for the ride! Luckily, we've had lots of visitors so far. Our latest set was Erik's cousin, Lia and her good friend, Sam.

We had a plethora of great meals, lots of laughs and some seriously fun times with our "primitas". They joined us for our weekend in [Colonia del Sacramento](http://schwartzography.com/2012/01/buen-suspiro-in-colonia-del-sacramento/), toured the world's largest pencil collection and forced us to stay out until the wee hours of the morning for a pub crawl (not pictured, doy!).

Hailing from The City of Brotherly Love, we found it funny that South Americans know Philly mostly from [its famous stairs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWFjD_e9OAg) and now of course, from [Kitten Mittons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY-qxa4rMGc). However, when we think about Philadelphia, we think of American history, noodles, meter reading, rap snacks, gabbagoo and our lovely family who lives there.

Thanks for coming to visit, chicas! We can't wait until next time!
