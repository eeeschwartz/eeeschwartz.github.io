Cheers to the USA! It's been a really incredible three months abroad, but we're finally back and looking forward to a fun summer at home.  

We touched down for a few days in Austin, TX for [SXSW](http://sxsw.com/). South by Southwest is a conference of insane tech, film and music industry types who take over this laid-back city in droves. It was all at once a super intense, super crazy and super fun way to reintegrate ourselves back in to US culture. Like they always say, you gotta rip off the Band-Aid.

One of our first stops was the [Cheezburger Network](http://www.cheezburger.com/) party. Luckily, there were no cute cats saying funny things, but [Fun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts) was there, and they were kinda fun I suppose, but they didn't bring Janelle Mon√°e, so we made our way up to the balcony, away from the throngs to hang out and peruse some swag.

We were lucky enough to meet up with our buddy [Jordan](https://twitter.com/#!/sneakstar), one of Erik's cohorts over at Table XI. Jordan is also the CEO and Founder of [Pegmo](http://www.pegmo.com/), so he's no stranger to the startup scene, and was a fantastic host for a couple of weary travelers such as ourselves.

We also got to meet up with our good friend, [Dan Friel](http://danfriel.com/). Dan played a really fun show sitting on the back of a booth. There really is live music in every corner of SXSW.

He had some pretty fancy footwork.

All and all, it was a crazy few days, but I'm glad we made it. As I sit on a farm, surrounded by chickens (seriously), I'm really grateful for this wild rollercoaster of a life we're living.
