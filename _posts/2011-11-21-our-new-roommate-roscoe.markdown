One of the fun parts of staying with [Bobby and Rachel](http://schwartzography.com/2011/11/lovers-leap-winery/) for the past few weeks is spending some quality time with our four-legged nephew, Roscoe. Roscoe is a chocolate lab with a powerful wag and some of the most amazing drool you've ever seen. Regardless, we love him and it's been really fun having our little buddy around these days.

I took Roscoe around for a quick photo shoot today-- and he was fierce! Something tells me this wasn't his first time [smizing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZhRz6DZSrM).
