Fall in the South is such a relief to the past 10 autumns we spent in Chicago. With temperatures reaching into the 70's most days, we've been taking advantage with lots of outdoor activities.

On our first free Sunday here, we hiked at [Raven Run](http://www.lexingtonky.gov/index.aspx?page=276), a nature sanctuary just inside the city limits. I came here quite a bit in my youth, so it was a fun trip down memory lane with my Yankee husband.

We hiked all the way up to the scenic overlook of the Kentucky River. Believe me, the dropoff here is steeper than it looks in the photo. I was definitely feeling the height at this point. However, a few butterflies in the belly are totally worth this amazing view, and the sense of quiet you can only find at the top of a mountain.
