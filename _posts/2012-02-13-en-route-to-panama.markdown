You guys! We made it to Panama safe and sound. But I have to say... getting here was the most fabulous part.

An eight hour flight is not so bad when you have this much leg room.

So, recently I've become quite the travel agent, and I'm really proud of the deals that I've been getting. We've had the opportunity to stay at some pretty [fabulous places](http://pinterest.com/smithschwartz/places-we-ve-lived-on-the-road/), all within our budget.

I was especially proud when I came across a deal that would get us from Buenos Aires to Panama City in first class, for a few hundred dollars less than the price of a coach ticket. Score!

As you can see, Erik shows his pride by handing out an Argentine 'great job' sign. Maybe next time I'll get a [high kick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-NshzYK9y0).
