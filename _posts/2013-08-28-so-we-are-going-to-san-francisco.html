<p>Throughout our travels, Chicago has served as a home base of sorts. We usually wind up here once every 2 months or so to touch base with friends and coworkers and to generally feel a sense of normalcy and familiarity.</p>  

<p>However, we’ve recently come across an interesting situation that is changing the course of our nomadic life. We met a couple of kindred nomadic spirits through our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kategarmey" title="Kate Garmey on Twitter" target="blank">Kate</a> (who is also quite the wanderer). This couple lives in San Francisco and are planning to travel around Asia for the next 6 months. They are looking for trustworthy tenants to take care of their home and cover their costs while they’re abroad, so  enter Schwartzography Housesitting, LLC. We are available to take care of your home’s needs while you travel the world.</p>

<p>So yeah, we’re headed to the Bay for at least the next 6 months. We are both super excited about this for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the sheer density of nerds and other like-minded folk in just 46.9 square miles of steep hills and steep rents. Rumor has it that finding a job is much easier than finding an apartment in SF, so since we found a place to live so quickly, we’re hoping to find our way into some interesting work as well. Erik has taken a sabbatical from working with the fine folks over at <a href="http://www.tablexi.com/" title="Table XI" target="blank">Table XI</a>, and I’m planning on making the move from <a href="http://smithschwartz.com/" title="Smith Schwartz" target="blank">freelance</a> to employee once we acclimate to the fog-filled environs. </p>

<p>This means we won’t be back to Chicago for quite some time, and we have definite mixed feelings about this. Even though we left 2 years ago to begin our nomadic adventure we've been back frequently. This time it seems more real, at least for the time being. We’re also interested to see what it feels like to stay in one place for at least 6 months. For us, this is a new kind of experiment.</p>

<p>That said, we’re enjoying our last week in this windy city with some sunshine and good times. If you’re local, we’re hanging out at the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/happy-village-chicago" title="Happy Village on Yelp" target="blank">Happy Village</a> on Friday night to say goodbye one more time, so please come join us!</p>
