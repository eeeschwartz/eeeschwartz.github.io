<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Schwartzography">Schwartzography</a> is powered by digital nomads <a href="https://twitter.com/smithschwartz">Smith</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/eeeSchwartz">Erik</a> Schwartz, who have been circling the globe since October 2011. After selling most of their belongings and giving up their apartment in Chicago, they’ve been living a life of slow travel throughout the U.S. and abroad while working online, eating egg-bean and cracking wise.</p>

<p>Smith Schwartz is a front-end developer, writer and speaker. She also authors the column, <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/authors/smith">Well-Designed Travel</a> at Apartment Therapy where she doles out advice on unique destinations around the world.</p>

<p>Erik Schwartz is a long-time developer/partner at Chicago’s <a href="http://www.tablexi.com/">Table XI</a> and musician of the past, present, and future. He also took a bunch of classes at Second City so he can be something of a cut up.</p>
